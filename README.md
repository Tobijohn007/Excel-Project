# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Data Analysis (Excel Project)

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes a bike sales dataset to uncover patterns and
relationships between demographic factors (such as marital status, age,
income, and region) and the likelihood of purchasing a bike. The
analysis was fully conducted in **Microsoft Excel**, utilizing data
cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard visualization techniques.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The dataset initially contained inconsistencies and missing values. Key
cleaning steps included: - Removing duplicates and invalid entries -
Standardizing categorical variables (e.g., gender, marital status) -
Ensuring numerical fields like income and age were properly formatted -
Creating a structured table ready for analysis

## 📈 Data Analysis

Using **Pivot Tables**, various analyses were performed, such as: - Bike
purchase rates by **marital status (single vs married)** - Average
**income** and **age** differences among buyers - Bike sales
distribution across **regions** and **commute distances** -
Cross-analysis of **education level** and **occupation** versus
purchasing behavior

## 🎨 Dashboard

An interactive **Excel dashboard** was built to visually summarize
insights: - Charts illustrating purchase trends by age, region, and
marital status - Filters to dynamically explore the dataset - KPIs
displaying total buyers, average income, and demographic breakdowns

## 🧰 Tools Used

-   **Microsoft Excel**
